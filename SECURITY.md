## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these private reporting channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred, if enabled)
2. Email: **<jscraik@brainwav.io>**

### What to include

- A clear description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce / proof of concept (as safe as possible)
- Affected versions/commits
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your preferred public credit name (optional)

### Response expectations

We'll acknowledge receipt as soon as practical and coordinate next steps. Timelines may vary depending on severity and maintainer availability.

## Coordinated disclosure

We prefer coordinated disclosure:

- We'll work on a fix and release
- We'll publish an advisory when appropriate
- We'll coordinate credit (if desired)

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- This repository's code and official release artifacts
- Vulnerabilities in default configurations and documented integrations

Out of scope (unless clearly exploitable in common usage):

- Vulnerabilities requiring unlikely user behavior
- Issues in third-party services not controlled by the project
- Social engineering, phishing, and physical attacks

## Safe harbor

We support good-faith security research intended to improve the safety of users. Please avoid:

- Privacy violations
- Data destruction
- Service disruption (DoS)
