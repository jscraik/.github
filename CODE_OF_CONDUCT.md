# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

We want a community where people can collaborate effectively, learn, and build useful things. This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior, provides a reporting path, and explains how enforcement works.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces and interactions, including:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, code reviews, discussions, and wikis
- Community chat/forums/video calls associated with the project
- In-person events explicitly organized under the project name

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and constructive; critique ideas, not people.
- Assume good intent, ask clarifying questions, and keep discussions on-topic.
- Use welcoming, inclusive language.
- Respect boundaries: if someone asks you to stop, stop.
- Be careful with privacy: don't share other people's personal info.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or demeaning comments.
- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Threats of violence, incitement, or encouraging self-harm.
- Stalking, doxxing, or sharing private information without consent.
- Sustained disruption (trolling, sealioning, spamming, "flamewars").
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Email: **<jscraik@brainwav.io>**
- If the concern is urgent and involves immediate safety risk, contact local emergency services first.

### What to include

- Links (issue/PR/discussion URLs), screenshots, relevant timestamps
- Who was involved, and what you observed
- Any immediate concerns (safety, ongoing harassment)

### Privacy

We will handle reports as confidentially as practical and limit information to those who need it to address the issue.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers (or a designated moderation team) are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Possible actions include:

- Asking for a change in behavior
- Removing or editing content
- Temporarily limiting participation
- Banning from project spaces

## Enforcement guidelines

Maintainers will consider context, severity, and whether this is a pattern.

1. **Correction**: Minor first-time issues; private or public request to adjust behavior.
2. **Warning**: Clear violation; explicit boundaries and consequences for further issues.
3. **Temporary restriction**: Time-limited ban from certain spaces (issues/discussions) for repeated or serious violations.
4. **Permanent ban**: Severe violations or repeated behavior after prior actions.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was incorrect, email **<jscraik@brainwav.io>** with:

- The link/context
- Why you believe the decision should be reconsidered
- Any supporting information
