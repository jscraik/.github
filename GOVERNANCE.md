# Governance

This document describes how the project is run, how decisions are made, and the roles people can hold.

## Values

- Transparent decision-making
- Respectful collaboration (see Code of Conduct)
- Pragmatic engineering: correctness, security, maintainability

## Roles

### Users

People who use the project and provide feedback.

### Contributors

People who contribute via issues, discussions, documentation, code, or reviews.

### Maintainers

People with write access who:

- Review and merge PRs
- Triage issues
- Manage releases and roadmap
- Enforce project standards (including Code of Conduct, with care)

### Security contacts

People responsible for coordinating vulnerability reports and advisories.

## Decision-making model

We use a **consensus-seeking** process:

1. Propose a change via issue/discussion/PR.
2. Seek feedback and iterate.
3. Maintainers decide when there is rough consensus and the change is ready.

For major decisions (examples):

- Breaking API changes
- Deprecation/removal of core features
- Governance changes

Maintainers should document the decision and rationale in an issue/discussion and may require explicit approval from multiple maintainers.

## Becoming a maintainer

Typical criteria:

- Sustained high-quality contributions over time
- Helpful reviews and issue triage
- Demonstrated alignment with project values
- Availability to participate in maintenance

Process:

1. Nomination by an existing maintainer (or self-nomination).
2. Discussion among maintainers (documented).
3. Approval by consensus or majority vote of active maintainers.

## Stepping down / inactivity

Maintainers may step down at any time. If a maintainer is inactive for an extended period, maintainers may move them to an emeritus status (no expectations, retains credit).

## Code of Conduct enforcement

The project follows `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Reports are handled via the channels described there.

## Changes to this document

Governance changes require an explicit maintainer decision and should be recorded in the PR that updates this file.
